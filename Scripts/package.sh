#!/bin/bash
#
#  package.sh - build a macOS installer containing the AU and the VST3.
#
#  Two things about this script are decisions rather than defaults.
#
#  **It builds before it packages, and build.sh runs KitboxCheck and every
#  EditorShot check.** Packaging a binary nobody verified is how a filter that
#  is 3 dB off or a hit that lands on a block boundary gets shipped. So there is
#  no way to reach an installer that skips them.
#
#  Copied from FX Analyzer's, which it matches step for step, on 2026-10-05.
#  Note that the installer writes to /Library, while Scripts/install.sh writes
#  to ~/Library - installing both on one machine lists the plugin twice.
#
#  **The version is read out of the built bundle, not written here.** It comes
#  from project() in CMakeLists.txt, through JUCE, into Info.plist. A version
#  string typed into a packaging script is a second source of truth, and the two
#  disagree the first time somebody bumps one of them.
#
#  The Standalone is deliberately not in the installer. It exists to develop
#  against - see the note in CMakeLists.txt - and the deliverables are the AU
#  and the VST3.
